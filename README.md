# CodeClauseGoldenTask1-Detection_Of_Parkinsons_Disease
In this project i have used several libraries such as NumPy , Pandas , Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze the data.

The project involve several processes such as Data Exploration ,Distribution Of classes , Exploratory Data Analysis , Visualisation through heatmaps , splitting the data into training and testing data.

After preprocessing the data , I used XGBoost Classifier Algorithm to build a training model.The model was trained using the training data and then i evaluated its performance on the test data.

Overall , this project aimed to detect parkinson's disease out of a given dataset.
